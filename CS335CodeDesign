Code Design for Julian and Mattâ€™s CS 335 Project:

Landscaping and Texturing:
	For the landscape and the 3D environment, we used simple shapes and textures to recreate
	a racetrack for our cars to race on. Even though I have no Java experience, I was able to 
	get a	fairly nice looking track and environment. Translates and rotates were used to keep 
	everything 	in place an draw it. For the billboarding technique I used a simple rotate based 
	on the angle 	between the camera and the tree object.
